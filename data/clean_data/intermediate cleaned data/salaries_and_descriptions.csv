The Health team is focused on leveraging Facebook to improve global health outcomes, and the Epidemic Response team is crucial to our long-term success. In H2 2020, the Epidemic Response team is primarily focused around efforts related to COVID19. End-to-end success includes (1) building datasets/models for the pandemic (2) working with public health organizations to derive relevant insights from those datasets/models and (3) working with policy makers (such as government officials) to change relevant policies in response to those insights.
Ongoing work includes Symptom Surveys, which have been created in partnership with CMU and UMD, our Preventive Behavior Surveys, which have been created in partnership with MIT and JHU, and programmatic efforts to support Contact Tracing.
In addition to executing and building upon our COVID19 efforts, the DS will also be responsible for generalizing our strategy (e.g. surveys, visualizations, prediction models, datasets, partnerships) for (1) what datasets we create for future pandemics (2) what datasets we create for new areas where we can meaningfully benefit public health and (3) how external, non-FB data can help improve the strategy of our existing Health teams.
Validate and analyze the data for the external datasets that we produce to shape our perspective on the accuracy and value of the data
Work closely with partnerships, Product Management and cross functional teams and third party organizations (academics, global health organizations) to maximize the value of the data that we produce
Identify public/private collaborations that can accelerate research/understanding around public health outcomes and the role Facebook can play here
Generalize our Pandemic Response data strategy and ideate for additional metrics that can help us expand beyond our existing surveys and data for application for future global epidemics as well as for future public health causes

You have super powers. Use them for good. We catch bad guys and stop online fraud. Its fun. Its hard. It matters. We need you.
Amazons Customer Trust and Partner Support (CTPS) team is engaged in a technological arms race: cyber-criminals from across the world continually look for new ways to steal from us and cover their tracks, while we invent new techniques to detect and neutralize them with ever increasing speed and scale.
Its fun. We dont just catch the bad guys; we stop crimes before they happen. Remember the ""Minority Report""? Its just like that. Basically, we predict the future by developing and applying cutting-edge machine learning systems to detect, predict, and prevent online fraud before it happens.
Its hard. This is Amazon, so of course our services are low latency, high throughput, highly scalable, and failure proof. Our fraud prevention systems are also highly reactive: we process multiple terabytes of data yet notice changes in individual behavior patterns in seconds. Even by Amazon standards, our datasets are massive and our transaction rates impressive, and everything is built with a scrupulous attention to security.
It matters. Amazon is one of the worlds most trusted companies. Consider the implications of losing that trust. Third-party sellers account for nearly half the items purchased on Amazon. This nearly always goes smoothly; but when sellers cheat buyers, everyone loses. Even after we refund their money, buyers are less likely to shop at Amazon in the future. Legitimate sellers lose potential sales and are less likely to sell on Amazon. And of course, the money Amazon pays in refunds and chargebacks goes straight to our bottom line and ultimately results in higher prices for all our customers.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Job Description
About the team. The Clinical Products data science team helps supercharge CVS-Aetna’s clinical programs to improve member health and lower costs. Given CVS-Aetna’s size, scope, and deep set of capacities, CVS-Aetna is an unparalleled platform to make a difference in healthcare in the US and beyond. The Clinical Products team has three main goals. First, CVS-Aetna is launching a series of clinical programs that use the resources of the combined CVS-Aetna, and our team delivers the advanced analytics to support those initiatives.

Safety evaluation is of fundamental importance to Waymo, and measuring it is subtle. This role works with a wide variety of teams across the company (onboard software engineering, product, safety, systems engineering) to evaluate the driving and safety performance of Waymo's self driving car. This is based on a wide variety of data from real and simulated driving from Waymo's self-driving system as well as from external data sources.
The Planner Team is responsible for ""motion planning"" for the self driving car. This includes gracefully handling many complex situations involving social interactions (merging, negotiating narrow roads, etc), while dealing with a noisy and uncertain environment. Evaluation of this onboard decision-making system is a complex, open-ended problem with tremendous potential impact. The quality of the road maneuvers we execute is subjective, contextual, and geometrically subtle, and evaluation needs apply to a wide variety of conditions with an extremely long tail.

Analysis and improvement of existing data sources and metrics
Development of novel approaches to measuring and improving
Self-driving performance (either generally, or for motion planning specifically)
Collaborate with engineers and other data scientists to evaluate and improve core
Waymo technologies, with a focus on bringing statistical depth, general analytical rigor, and accurate causal interpretation of data.

549,US,"About us:
Grand Rounds is a new kind of healthcare company. Founded in 2011, the company is on a mission to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone, everywhere. The Grand Rounds team goes above and beyond to connect and guide people to the highest quality healthcare available for themselves and their loved ones. Grand Rounds creates products and services that give people the best possible healthcare experience. Named a 2019 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and Rock Health’s 2018 Fastest Growing Company, Grand Rounds works with inspiring employers and doctors to empower them to be the change agents we need to make our shared vision a reality.

The Role: Data Scientists at Grand Rounds work on problems that are core to the company’s mission. Major challenges include developing systems and models to identify the highest quality doctors in the country as well as methodologies to uncover the subtle differences between each physician’s clinical expertise. Additionally, patient-level modeling allows us to understand the specific healthcare needs of every person. With a high fidelity understanding of both patients and physicians we are able to route patients to both appropriate and high quality care. In addition to developing the company’s core technologies, data scientists provide decision support analysis for many teams across the organization including product development, sales, marketing, and strategy. Data scale ranges from small data sets that fit on a single laptop to large multi-terabyte clinical information in distributed database systems.

This particular role within the Data Science team will focus on building our behavioral health (BH) related services. The US will be short over 16,000 psychiatrists by 2025, not to mention limitations of other types of BH providers, and the availability/access to/quality of the existing providers. Further, members with BH needs often have other physical conditions and the coexistence of BH needs with chronic conditions may 2-3x the costs of care. This role will use a mixture of structured data and text based data (Natural Language Processing skills a plus) to help identify members’ needs, match members to top providers, and determine which BH providers have the experience in particular domains. It is also a highly cross-functional role, as you will work closely with our Clinical and Product teams to help support our members’ needs during these difficult times.

We are looking for someone with strong NLP experience on difficult applications that recognizes the importance of maintaining a balance between cutting edge techniques and simple, scalable solutions. Having experience in the Behavioral Health space is strongly desired.
Example Projects include:
Predict who may have a BH need. A member’s care can be greatly enhanced if a clinician is aware of BH risks or needs of the member they are speaking with. However, because BH is faced with a negative stigma in the United States or a member just may not know to bring it up, the member may not discuss their BH needs with the clinician. If we can determine BH associated risks that our members face, our clinicians can professionally ask relevant questions to better treat, guide, and route members through the health care system. We strive to build NLP tools and systems to mine our rich text-based data to determine the types of BH risks/needs our members may have. We use the minimum necessary de-identified data to derive insights, and these insights are presented only to the treating professionals.

BH provider quality modeling. Unfortunately, not all providers are equal. Due to differences in judgment, training, and prior experience we find that there is a huge range in the clinical outcomes they can drive. Further, as different providers have different expertise, it is a non-trivial problem to determine which patients are best treated by which providers. Grand Rounds is a leader in the field of determining clinical quality, and we hope to further extend our tooling and modeling expertise to additional aspects of BH. Instead of just going to a generic in-network provider, this effort will help route our members to providers with a proven track record in the specific area of their need.
Responsibilities:
Help imagine and then create the Grand Rounds Behavioral Health offering
Help build the tooling to make sense of rich, largely untapped data assets, including text-based dataLead and develop major projects from end-to-end encompassing planning, design, technical implementation, debugging, roll-out to Product & Engineering, testing, and iteration
Operate at level of sophistication in statistics, machine learning, or computer science that is publication-worthy
Regularly monitor pull requests, perform code reviews, and produce excellent peer reviews on projects prior to shipping to Product & Engineering
Evaluate and experiment with new technologies and tools prior to wider adoption by the team
Work closely with analysts, data scientists, product managers, clinicians, and engineers
Qualifications:
BS with 8+ years or MS with 6+ years or PhD with 3+ years of experience. Degree(s) should be in a technical discipline such as Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Math, quantitative social science
Work experience leading complex Data Science and Engineering projects
Experience with NLP techniques for text representation (e.g. n-grams, sentiment analysis, bag of words, vectorization, etc.), semantic extraction / named entity recognition, annotation, summarization, relation extraction, and intent recognition. Conversational agent experience is a plus
Experience with SQL relational databases as well as big data
Required: Python, SQL, Linux Shell Scripting
Frequent user of cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform
Excellent verbal communications, including the ability to clearly and concisely articulate complex concepts to both technical and non-technical collaborators
Business intuition and product sense that help you identify the most impactful projects to work on to address current and future business needs
Bonus Points for: background in Behavioral Health or Healthtech

Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans. We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come. About New Mexico New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great. Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC. New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair. Don’t care. Tattoos. Show off your ink. Like polka dots. That’s cool. Pop culture geek. Many of us are. Passion for technology and world-changing? Be you with us.

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist – Causality Expert based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Science - Deep Learning Research based in London to join the team working on our exciting machine learning product. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We’re an innovation and transformation consultancy that believes in the power of ingenuity to build a positive-human future in a technology-driven world. Our diverse teams of experts combine innovative thinking with breakthrough-technologies to progress further, faster.

Those that start using AI and advanced data analytics early will gain the most. While the technology is yet to live up to the hype, using it now gives a chance to get ahead, learn and improve to drive long-term value.

It’s essential to start with developing and deploying use cases and meanwhile building a capability around artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced data analytics. It’ll be a key differentiator in the short term, and a necessity in the long term.

Data Architects - We’re experts in uncovering the real story buried in data. We are looking for data architects who know how the future data platforms look like and know how they interact with existing legacy clients’ architecture.
In recent projects our team have:
Analysed the blogosphere to identify influencers
Used voice and text analytics to predict customer sentiments and Net Promotor Scores

** Digital Pure Play Business – Market Leader **
SALARY - £55k - £65k plus excellent benefits, including lots of training and development opps
LOCATION - Remote / Central London
We are searching for an experienced Data Scientist to join this digital services business, working amongst a growing team of Data Scientists.
You will be working alongside some very credible data experts who hail from the likes of Aimia and Dunnhumby.
This organisation is hugely invested in data and using this to drive decisioning and targeted marketing across the business, illustrated by the strength of their senior leadership team, including a CDO.
The culture is one of ambition and they are keen to grow the division and the technical abilities within that function, in order to put data central to the business.
We are after someone with a data science skill set, a hacker, someone who can solve business problems using a variety of data science techniques, in order to provide highly valuable insights around customer experience, pricing strategies, personalisation and customer behaviour. Technically we need someone with advanced skills in Python as well as SQL, and someone who is open to knowledge sharing and mentoring peers.
Projects currently include building segmentations, machine learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, classification, k-means, linear regression, Naïve Bayes etc.) and predictive models to provide as detailed view of the customer as possible.

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the Role

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the Role

We are looking for a senior data science manager to join our management team. We are looking for someone who:
Has experience managing data science managers as well as individual contributors.
Has experience being a data scientist at a mid/senior level, but is now not looking to do individual contributor work.
Has experience working with C-level stakeholders, as well as other stakeholders business wide.
Is able to set company level strategy.
Is able to bring together a group of individuals from many different backgrounds and skill sets to form a cohesive team.
Is comfortable managing multiple teams in different business areas, and ruthlessly prioritising.
Is comfortable working in an extremely fast, constantly changing environment, with incredibly high standards.
Has a pragmatic, flexible approach, and most cares about achieving impact.
Life at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",,Lead Data Scientist,585,135720.0,135720.0,,Deliveroo,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,,0,0.0,,0,,0,0,0,0,,0.0,,0,0,,,0.0,0.0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,,,0,"London, England",3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2013.0,128760.0,135720.0,,142680.0

About the company

Essence is a digital agency that delivers strategy, media, creative and social solutions globally. It is the digital agency of record for sophisticated clients such as Google, ITV and Airbnb; clients at the leading edge of the digital marketplace.

Over the last 15 years, we've successfully redefined what it means to be a 'digital agency'.

Cerebri AI CVX platform uses the best Artificial Intelligence ( AI ), Operation Research ( OR ), and software to provide what is required in our digital age: value a customer's commitment to a brand and related products. It then uses these insights to then drive the selling of product and services. We use AI to answer the fundamental questions of the digital age: Who talks to the customer? Who understands the customer? How do we do this at scale when we have millions of customers?
Cerebri AI CVX platform uses a 10-stage AI software pipeline manages & processes data intake thru to producing insights and actions & presenting them via our APIs, in our customers' systems, or our UX. Our AI pipeline's first five stages manage data intake, a crucial step in producing great insights. One customer journey ( CJ ) per customer means all models targeting CX and revenue KPIs and related next best actions ( NBAs ) use the same journeys.
We work with companies selling to over 200 million consumers and have 24 patents filed on the Cerebri AI platform. We now have 40 employees in three offices in Austin, Toronto, and Washington DC. Over 80% of the staff are in technical roles in data science and software engineering.
How do we do this? We hire the best data scientists, mathematicians, and software developers and work as a cross-disciplinary team/gang/clan. We work hard, laugh hard, and impress our peers and clients. Because we can. And because we want to. To learn more, visit cerebriai.com.
