567,Praemo,"About Praemo:
Founded by industry experts and focused on the appropriate application of leading-edge analytic technologies like AI within industrial operations, we believe there is a simpler, more cost, time and operationally effective way to harvest insights from the Industrial and Manufacturing data sets that already exist.
Praemo is an advanced data and analytics company that builds solutions utilized by a wide range of industrial operations. From discrete manufacturing to consumer-packaged goods to mining and process plants, our technology, RazorTM fills a critical gap. Utilizing an organization’s operational and IoT (Internet of Things) data as-is, where-is, and applying AI (artificial intelligence) tools like ML (Machine Learning), RazorTM transforms existing, under-utilized data into context relevant insights. These insights alert industrial operators to any anomaly with the potential to harm performance in time to prevent it.

As we build the future of consumer insurance in a modern age, data is at the core of everything that we do. The role requires team members who are adept at using large data sets to find opportunities for optimization and can leverage appropriate models to test the effectiveness of different courses of action. Our team uses a variety of data mining and analysis methods, a variety of data tools, builds and implements models, develops algorithms, and creates simulations. Team members must be very comfortable writing production-ready code to include testing and maintenance infrastructure, and able to put models and analysis into production with no support from engineering (we own our stack end to end). At Assurance, we hire experts in their field, and we give them the independence and trust to build based on their expertise.
