Other information
The Public Service of Canada is committed to building a skilled and diverse workforce that reflects the Canadians we serve. We promote employment equity and encourage you to indicate if you belong to one of the designated groups when you apply.
Information on employment equity
You must meet all essential qualifications in order to be appointed to the position. Other qualifications may be a deciding factor in choosing the person to be appointed. Some essential and other qualifications will be assessed through your application. It is your responsibility to provide appropriate examples that illustrate how you meet each qualification. Failing to do so could result in your application being rejected.

When answering the screening questions, the assessment board cannot make assumptions about your experience. It is insufficient to say that you have the required qualifications or to list your current or past duties. Rather, candidates must demonstrate how they meet the education and experience criteria listed in the job opportunity advertisement by providing clear and concrete examples.

Clear and concrete examples are defined as illustrations in which you fully explain the actions, considerations and steps you completed in order to gain the experience you are describing. This detailed, contextual information will be used by the board members reviewing your submission to assess whether you have sufficient experience in a relevant field. This is similar to what would be expected if you were asked to provide a concrete example of a particular situation in an interview. Such examples usually require a minimum of ½ page to describe and a maximum of 2 pages. In order to facilitate this process, you may wish to start your submissions with a sentence similar to: ""A clear and concrete example of a situation where I did X is a situation which occurred on Y date and my role in this activity was to..."".

Resumes will be used as a secondary source of information and to strictly validate the concrete examples you will have described in this tool.

Also, when reading the experience criteria for staffing processes, please pay close attention to action words contained within and ensure the examples you choose pertain to all of them. Similar attention should be given to punctuation and connector words such as ""commas"", ""and"" and ""or"" as these have a different function when used to describe an experience criteria. As such, action words or activities separated with a "","" and connected with an ""and"" must all be demonstrated with concrete examples as in this case, they are all deemed essential by the hiring manager. Conversely, when action words or activities are separated with a "","" and connected with an ""or"", candidates may provide concrete examples for only one of the activities listed in the criterion since.

For example, when responding to a criterion which reads: ""Experience reading, writing and publishing instructions for a competitive process."" you must provide concrete examples of situations where you read instructions, concrete examples of situations where you wrote instructions as well as concrete examples of situations where you published instructions for a competitive process. These may be part of the same example however, you must ensure to provide sufficient details to cover the three actions as they are all critical.

On the other hand, when responding to an experience criterion which reads: ""Experience reading, writing or publishing instructions for a competitive process"" you must provide concrete examples for a minimum of one situation where you either read, wrote or published instructions for a competitive process as experience in a minimum of one activity is critical. This being said, when this structure is used, you may also provide concrete examples for all action words or activities as this approach will provide board members with additional information to assess the breath of your experience.

Finally, if the examples you provide speak of experience that was acquired in a team setting, please be specific as to your exact role within this team as it is your experience the board will be looking to assess and not that of your team.

SenseNet Inc. is seeking an intern to join an R&D team of scientist-engineers to help develop and refine the artificial intelligence/machine learning platform and our sensor networks we are developing to make sense of the data from a network of environmental sensors.
Job description
The position is for a software developer that is familiar with programming languages that mostly pertain to artificial intelligence and machine learning. These languages will be applied by the candidate to help us refine existing features and implement new capabilities for our forest fire detection software platform.

About NovoBind
Cutting edge? Check. Amazing cause? Check. Check. If you’re a talented Scientist, in vitro who wants to make a difference in the world, keep reading.

NovoBind Livestock Therapeutics is an agri-biotech company working to combat rising antibiotic resistance. We do this by developing next generation biologics that target and neutralize the specific bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause microbiome-based ailments in livestock and aquaculture. Our novel biotherapeutic solutions, based on nanobodies (or single domain antibodies), present an innovative alternative to conventional treatments.

The impact of our work is economic and social—and widespread. Our targeted antimicrobials help to prevent animal diseases, improving the health and treatment of livestock while reducing the risk of major outbreaks. This in turn prevents economic losses in the agriculture and aquaculture industries, and stops dangerous pathogens from entering the environment or reaching the consumer food market. Our work even crosses over into the health of companion animals and plants, and may one day yield solutions for human illnesses as well.

Who We Are
A highly specialized team of biochemists, microbiologists, veterinary pathologists, academics and business professionals with a shared ambition to become the global leaders in targeted antimicrobials. We innovate three times before breakfast and show up to work wearing our favourite science-themed t-shirts.
