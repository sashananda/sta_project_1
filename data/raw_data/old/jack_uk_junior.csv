10,Evidera,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research
*There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:

Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience
Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Weve solved many complex problems to get to where we are today, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead of us, and Alexa is getting smarter every day. The problems we solve in the Alexa Knowledge team in Cambridge help Alexa get smarter by understanding the different ways people talk, by learning more and more facts about the world, by improving her common sense reasoning and by responding in the most natural way possible in multiple languages. We set out to build Alexa at Amazon because we believe that voice will fundamentally improve the way people will interact with technology, and we wanted to create a computer that could be controlled entirely by your voice.

On the Alexa Knowledge team, we are constantly making Alexa smarter by enabling her to learn about whats going on in the world. We use many different techniques to enable learning and reasoning across a range of structured and unstructured data. We are constantly at the forefront of both research and engineering in understanding user demands and data sources, to extract the right knowledge, expand the range of, and how, Alexa accesses information all to improve Alexa and give users the best experience. We believe that the information to answer (almost) every question can be found somewhere on the internet, and not just in an encyclopedia. Our goal is to teach Alexa how to autonomously consume a wider range of texts and expand her Knowledge Graph to learn more about the world.

We use multiple Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to validate the information extracted from various structured and unstructured sources, at internet-level scale. This requires methods that lie beyond the cutting edge academic and industrial research of today. The scope of this role is broad, covering a diverse range of problem space that include, but are not limited to fact verification, natural language inference, large-scale categorisation, weakly supervised or self-supervised learning methods etc. As a senior scientist, you will bring academic and/or industrial practical experience and create novel solutions to complex problems. You will guide junior scientists, collaborate with the best researchers in the field and work with the engineering team to bring your solutions to the millions of customers who use Alexa every day.

81,King's College London,"Job description
Background
The postholder will be a key researcher in an MRC-funded project to study the mechanisms of response and resistance to novel epigenetic therapies in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). This position will be supervised by Dr Lynn Quek, based in King's College London's Denmark Hill Campus.
AML is an aggressive bone marrow cancer which is incurable in the majority of patients. Our focus is to improve our understanding this disease with an ultimate aim to translate this knowledge to better treatments for patients. The focus of our research is to better understand the biology of leukaemia propagating cells in patient-derived AML which are mutated in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 genes. This important group of AMLs account for 20-30% of all AMLs.
Inhibitors of mutant IDH enzymes such as Ivosidenib and Enasidenib have recently been developed and FDA-approved to treat IDH-mutant AML. We have shown that IDH inhibitors restore blood function in AML patients by inducing differentiation of leukaemic cells previously unable to differentiate normally into mature blood cells (Amatangelo et al. Blood, 2017). We recently described the clonal dynamics of response and resistance to IDH inhibitor therapy in patients and demonstrated the impact of clonal heterogeneity on the function of AML cells in vivo (Quek et al. Nature Medicine, 2018).
We are looking for an ambitious research scientist with excellent computational skills and experience, who takes pride in performing scientific work to high technical standards. The successful candidate will have excellent organisation skills, who can demonstrate that (s)he is ready to take on new challenges. This postholder will be a key member of a team to study the metabolic and epigenetic events which underlie cell fate decisions in human patient IDH-mutant AML cells treated with IDH inhibitors, and be involved in analysis of clinical trial data.
This work requires expertise in analysis NGS data including WES, bulk and single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq. Knowledge of methylation-seq would be an advantage. Previous experience of medical statistics and analysis of clinical data is desirable. The candidate should have a good understanding of laboratory techniques used to study haematopoiesis and leukaemia, including multi-omics and flow cytometry. The postholder will be expected to be self-driven in developing new skills. The postholder may be asked to co-supervise junior members of team and provide training in computational methods.
We are able to offer wider support and networking with computational teams within our network of collaborative research groups within KCL.
The successful candidate will have a good track record in Haematology research, demonstrate self-motivation, independent critical thinking, flexibility and good teamwork. This post will be ideal for a computational scientist who has a background in Clinical Haemato-oncology, especially in myeloid malignancies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. There may be opportunities for additional clinical work that would attract additional clinical pay supplements (e.g. supporting outpatient clinics and clinical trials activity) for the suitably qualified individual.
Dr Quek is especially interested in helping promising researchers develop their career and will suit an early career clinical academic looking for post-doctoral experience prior to application for a post-doctoral intermediate research fellowship. This project will provide excellent scientific training, working in an area that has direct relevance to patient care.

About the Role
We have an exciting opportunity for a Lead Data Engineer in our UK team! This is a brand-new role in our UK office which has come about due to business growth and a need to better support our clients locally.
Whilst this role is based in London*, the Lead Data Engineer will form part of the DOT (Data and Operations Team) who are predominantly based in our HQ in Paris and are responsible for working on data architecture, data engineering and development of data science projects.

As the Lead Data Engineer, you will be leading challenging projects with international clients across diverse industries. This role will see you building bespoke analytics solutions to answer the key questions and consulting on the findings, (including presenting to senior clients).
The primary focus of the Lead Data Engineer will be to lead the development of data projects, from advisory through to project management, with client interactions ranging from technical teams to CIOs.

Your responsibilities will be spread across data architecture, business management, people management and Eki Life (the things that make us who we are), and include:
Lead projects from the kick-off meetings all the way through to final recommendations;
Analysing business requirements, translating these into strategic architecture and organisational recommendations and implementing projects within the set architecture and governance;
Driving high client value and broadening relationships at the most senior levels with current and prospective clients and translating this into new business opportunities for Ekimetrics.
Developing the skills of more junior team members, strengthening their impact on work across core areas of the clients’ businesses;
Supporting the business development initiatives and thought-leadership, transfer of knowledge to junior team members, and continuing to build Ekimetrics reputation and brand within the UK.
Please note, due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, we are currently working remotely. In any case, we fully support working from home, however, the office will be the primary place of work as and when it is safe to return.*
About You
The work will be rooted in the creation of innovative analytic engagements for clients so to be successful in this role, you need to be an all-rounder. You have a balance of business strategy understanding, client-facing consulting experience, and significant data and analytics expertise.
You’ll currently be in a Senior Data Engineer or Solutions/Data Architect role (or similar) in which you regularly work alongside world-class data scientists and senior stakeholders, both internally and client-side. You’re looking to take your next step and the opportunity to develop and lead a small data operations team excites you.
You’ve already got strong experience in data architecture, with knowledge in both BI and Big Data architectures, either on-prem or in the Cloud (e.g. Azure, AWS or GCP, etc.). You are also proficient in key technologies related to data management, (e.g. SQL, Spark, Python), and are familiar in at least some aspects of data management itself, (e.g. governance processes and platforms, data visualisation, transformation in data-warehouses or data-lakes). You’re ready to grow yourself in the others!
You’re comfortable building and managing relationships with stakeholders of all levels, adapting your approach accordingly, and able to translate technical terms into language that your clients can understand.
Although you will be working with the Paris DOT, you will initially be a standalone function in the UK so, whilst it’s important that you excel at the strategic and theoretical aspects of evolving information systems, you are also hands on and not afraid to get stuck into the detail as well. For example, you’re not only interested in the pure architecture, but also building the pipelines.

In the UK, we are a team of ~30 consultants of varying backgrounds, experience and passions, all contributing value to Ekimetrics’ success. We have a modern, open-plan office in central London, but we have clients across Europe.

119,Genestack Ltd,"Genestack's mission is to accelerate health discoveries by harnessing the explosive growth of biomedical data. As the core currency of the future, organisations need to manage data effectively in order to remain competitive. Founded in 2012 in Cambridge, UK, our product, the Omics Data Manager (ODM), is now transforming how scientists collaboratively work with multi-omics data, for drug development, crop improvement, and others.
One of the most urgent needs in data management is to source, organise and prepare “clean” data in a data management system like ODM, so the data are ready for consumption by bioinformatics data scientists to perform analyses on drug target validity or biomarker discovery, as well as by artificial intelligence/machine-learning (AI/ML) algorithms as good quality training sets. The bio and agri-industries are starting to be aware of the prerequisite of having good-quality data, to avoid spurious results in downstream scientific discoveries.
If you are a data manager with a biology background, and are eager to make this prerequisite a reality as soon as possible for data scientists at Genestack and our ODM customers, we want to hear from you.
Your goals
Source, import and maintain high-quality data in ODM by performing data extract-transform-load (ETL) functions:
retrieving data regularly from large public repositories or ad hoc from individual high-profile projects,
creating, running, adapting and maintaining data transformation Python scripts,
loading the transformed data into ODM by running existing data loading code.
Collaborate closely with Genestack data scientists by preparing “clean” data, allowing your colleagues to focus on tasks such as performing statistical analyses on the data.
Maintain and update existing ontologies/vocabularies/dictionaries and auxiliary data (e.g. reference genome sequences) to ensure interoperability of the data.
Develop and grow business relationships with our customers' data managers and/or engineers by providing expert advice on how to prepare “clean” data, so our customers can get the maximum value out of ODM.




Required technical competencies
You are proficient in ingesting, persisting and exporting large volumes of biological omics data and metadata from disparate sources using common file transfer protocols (e.g. HTTP, FTP) and RESTful APIs.
You have domain knowledge about omics data captured in common data formats (e.g. GFF, GCT, VCF, FASTA, FASTQ, BAM)
You have used or constructed controlled vocabularies/ontologies, and are familiar with the related file formats (e.g. OWL, OBO, SKOS).
You are proficient in writing bespoke scripts in Python for wrangling and transforming data from a source into required formats.
You pay a lot of attention to details to ensure subtle differences or discrepancies in data are not overlooked.
You understand how auxiliary/reference data (e.g. reference genome sequences) are used in the analysis and interpretation of omics data.
You understand what a ""data model"" is and, using your omics domain knowledge, can make recommendations to Genestack software engineers/architects on its design.
Desirable technical background
You are familiar with biological and/or clinical data standards and formats
You have worked in a biology R&D laboratory in academia or industry setting.
You have a basic understanding of how data search platforms work, e.g. Solr.



Desirable personal qualities
You are a passionate ambassador for good-quality, well-managed data that markedly improves the precision of R&D discoveries by our customers.
You take pride in working persistently with a high volume of messy data, a task often resented by some scientists as being mundane, while under time pressures for business needs.
You are a competent communicator, both verbally and in writing, who enjoys working in cross-functional teams both in Genestack and with our customers.
You are proactive in flagging and mitigating any risks which can spoil our customers' ODM experience.
Your career growth at Genestack
As a fast-growing company in the exciting intersection of big data, technology, and genomics, you will be:
Enabling data-driven transformation for leading life sciences organisations.
Supported by professional training and mentoring schemes.
Trusted with plenty of pivotal opportunities and responsibilities.
Building a diverse and far-reaching professional network.
Well-compensated with company-performance bonuses, health services, and above-rate pension contribution.
If you feel that this excites you and you meet these criteria, we would love to hear from you!

Since launching our business credit card and business loans in 2017 we have taken off like a rocket! We are one of the fastest growing companies in the UK (Sunday Times Fast Track 100 in 2017, 2018 and 2019), and we've continued to show stable profitability throughout Covid-19. We anticipate that both our profitability and growth will continue, and if anything accelerate - in part supported by having been certified under two of the government backed lending schemes (BBLS and CBILS).
This puts us in a strong position to help even more small businesses! Our passion for collaborating and helping small businesses thrive has only increased as a result of the current crisis. This means the work from here on out is only going to get even more interesting and we are looking for a diverse and talented team to join us on our journey moving forward.

Constantly refining our decisioning process to improve its efficiency through greater use of automation
What we are looking for
5+ years of using SAS, R or Python on a regular basis to build statistical predictive models
Experience of assessing and monitoring statistical predictive models

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the Role
The central Customer Care management team is expanding rapidly and the Global Workforce Management & Planning team needs to mirror this growth in order to provide outstanding support to our Customer Care teams. We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

It's a bonus if you have:
Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

151,Evidera,"Project Lead / Research Scientist (Systematic Literature Review) – Meta Research

There are two Research Scientist openings. We are looking to fill these roles in our London, UK office; however, we will consider other locations based on the candidates’ experience and qualifications.
The Team

Just about anyone seeking published articles to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. Poorly designed search algorithms, unworkable PICOS criteria and failure to follow PRISMA study-reporting guidelines are just a few of many things that often go wrong with such attempts at literature reviewing. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:

Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy
Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators
Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors
Capitalize on existing research while assessing evidence gaps
Provide information for value development planning
Determine which databases have proved useful in target indications
Derive model inputs
Create burden-of-illness assessments for submission to payers
Publish burden assessments for dissemination
Populate dossiers
Populate regulatory documents such as Risk Management Plans.
The Role
You’re different. You understand and can explain convincingly why systematic literature reviews are crucial. And you have that rare combination of technical knowhow, experience and enthusiasm necessary to successfully lead such research. That’s what we’ll want from you as a Research Scientist in our Meta Research team. Perhaps you’re skilled too in network meta-analysis (NMA) and/or epidemiology, and so will add to the team’s strengths in these or other specialist areas. But whatever your specific background and interests, you’ll be able to help ensure that the team’s thinking and approach to systematic literature reviews take account of cutting-edge research and best scientific and consulting practice. In addition, as a principal investigator on individual literature review projects and subsequent analyses, you’ll direct, oversee and have overall responsibility for all aspects of study design and execution. A natural collaborator, you’ll provide clients with strategic consultation and advice on how best to address research needs, and work closely with and guide project managers and other research associates in delivering the required studies. Specific accountabilities of the Research Scientist role are detailed below.

You will:
Design and implement systematic and targeted literature reviews and further analysis.
Conceptualize advanced study designs and develop study protocols.
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments.
Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick-off meetings and bid defense meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
Support sales through methodological excellence (systematic reviews and/or NMAs)
Review, track and own annual sales target
Direct other ""non-billable"" activities (e.g. design conceptual approaches for proposals, supervise junior staff, identify and pursue business opportunities within Evidera and bring in new projects).
Serve as consultant to other principal investigators or staff on other systematic review projects.
Act as a guide and mentor to the staff across Evidera locations.
Travel (internationally), as is expected.
Skills and Experience

Demonstrated experience in systematic review (SLR) methods in health economics and/or health services research.
Deep understanding of research principles, relevant methodology and practical research implementation.
Specialist skills in network meta-analysis or epidemiology would be desirable, but are not essential.
Experience with HTA/regulatory submissions, including National Institute for Health and Care. Excellence, SMC, and other European HTA bodies and the European Medicines Agency
Excellent communication skills, including presentations.
Competent in written and spoken English.
Experience in using MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

About Cuvva
We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 80+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?
We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.

We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.

And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.

About Cuvva

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
