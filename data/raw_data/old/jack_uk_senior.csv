We are building a platform that turns data and information into knowledge and links it to real-world business operations. We do this by creating AI-powered data assets that join up the information flows and physical flows within an organisation to enable trust in data by improving its quality at the source and help businesses find value by using data, information and knowledge to power ML and AI tools that drive real outcomes.

Our first and primary focus is in healthcare operations, where silos in operational information leads to impacts on the ability of clinicians to deliver the most important part of their job: good patient care. These silos reach through a healthcare provider stretching from the point of care out through the healthcare provider’s organisation (a hospital, a clinic, etc.), and into the wider world (community care, supply chains, etc). Our platform will help an organisation to use the data it already has by enhancing at the source to improve trust in the data and link it together using cutting edge techniques of knowledge representation. Our platform uses intelligent software tools and machine learning models to drive value throughout the operational structure, from the point of care out through the provider and into the world, improving patient outcomes, health operations like patient flow, procurement, and more.

We’re home to 5,000 phenomenal small creative businesses that we are proud to call our Partners. But, now more than ever, this community needs our support. So we’re doing all we can to shine a light on these dynamic entrepreneurs, waving the flag for small businesses and generally championing their socks off.

On top of our brilliant Partners, products and customers (not to mention our incredible team who have been busy beavering away from home since March), the last 12 months has seen great progress with our tech platform and customer experience.

We need to be able to optimise our site scientifically. A/B testing is a good start, but we need you to push the envelope with more sophisticated and efficient approaches such as multi-armed bandits

Senior Data Scientist

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations

The role:
You will be the only person in the data team right now, with a chance to work closely with the CTO and CEO to build out your own team.
The initial solution has been built and you'll be able to lean on an external consultant initially, so it's not a completely blank canvas, but there is still lots to do.
You'll be working at a small start-up, so you can expect no two days to be the same and you'll get the chance to be involved in pretty much everything from the start.
From a data perspective, they have lots of it, the problem they are solving is novel and the application is pretty obvious, so all in all, a good place to be.
You:
To be successful in the role, you'll have to be confident with working in a small start-up where some days might be a bit mad and you'll roll up the sleeves and get involved in just about everything.
You'll need to be confident in your skills as a Data Scientist, with the ability to talk to non-data people about your work. Communication is key.

They are also able to use this system in numerous different industries, making the potential for diversification very intriguing.
Established by an industry expert and backed by some impressive investors, they have big plans and as machine learning is such a key part to this, this role is critical.
Salary/Package:
The role is with an early stage start-up, so as you might expect, the benefits list isn't huge.

Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

WHO YOU ARE:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

About Cuvva
We’re making insurance radically better. How? By building insurance that’s fair and flexible.

Insurance is completely broken. It’s outdated, complicated, rigid – and we get it, insurance (as you know it) doesn’t sound very exciting. But we’re doing things differently. Using pretty cool technology, we’re making insurance way more fit for the 21st century, building products that actually solve problems.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly car insurance via an app. And we’re also the only insurance provider that provides in-app customer support with an average one minute response time. We’ve sold over 2 million policies and supported over 300,000 customers. We’re a strong, talented team of 80+ and growing.

Why work for Cuvva?
We don’t cut corners. We strive to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.

We’ve nurtured an awesome team culture. We always speak up when we have an idea - but also know when to let go and get behind something else.

And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things.

We’re building a diverse team from different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. Everyone is given a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance, trust us, you’ll love what we’re building.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear. So we've cut out the middlemen, ditched the jargon and put our heart and soul into customer support.",,Insurance Agencies & Brokerages,"London, England",Senior Data Scientist - Marketing / Growth,4.3,Unknown / Non-Applicable,Insurance,51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private,2014

Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.

You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",,Internet,"London, England",Senior Data Science Manager,3.5,Unknown / Non-Applicable,Information Technology,1001 to 5000 Employees,Company - Private,2013

About The Team

The Managed Rules Team is working on building the best in class Web Application Firewall (WAF). We do this by maintaining the rules that make up the WAF (based on wirefilter) and proactively looking for the next vulnerabilities across levels 3-7 of the OSI Model. We can do this by using our massive amounts of data, and work in tandem with vendors to add WAF-based protections before vulnerabilities are disclosed. We accomplish these goals by building the next generation of tools to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities. In response our tooling enables us to iterate quickly on rules, as well as deploying with confidence to our millions of customers. We are a polyglot team that utilizes Rust, Go, and Python to build our services and tools.

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

259,DueDil,"About DueDil

DueDil provides real-time insights on every company, helping financial services providers to give small businesses the products they need to thrive.

Reliance on manual checks makes it harder for SMEs to open an account, take out a loan or get insurance cover. It also makes it harder for the companies providing those products to carry out ongoing Know Your Business checks.

DueDil's KYB for Life platform transforms how providers work with SMEs. We analyse billions of data points on millions of companies to provide unique insights via our API.

In the last three years, DueDil has grown rapidly in the UK and Ireland and we're now expanding into mainland Europe. We have over 400 clients across the Financial Services, Insurance and Fintech sectors, including Santander, Tide and Metro Bank.

Our Values

We're driven by three core values, the characteristics that define the members of our team are grit, authenticity, and team spirit. These values factor into the way we hire, promote, and reward every member of our team. Put simply, we're looking for ambitious people who take ownership and responsibility - if this sounds like you then you're in the right place! You can read more about our values and how they impact our culture day to day here: https://www.duedil.com/about-duedil/who-we-are

The Role

Critical to achieving DueDil's vision is our ability to combine multiple disparate data sources from different providers into a unified view of companies and the people who run them. This requires us to develop web crawlers, automated matching algorithms, machine learning models and complex ETL processes to tie all these components together.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you'll help enhance and expand our data processing and distributed systems toolsets to support our international expansion effort, while maintaining quality and reliability of our existing data products and services. This will mean dealing with challenges such as order of magnitude increase in data volumes, assessing quality of data from multiple suppliers and building pipelines and services using modern cloud tools to match and extract valuable insight from these datasets. We value DevOps culture so you will take full ownership of your solutions from prototyping all the way to production, and you'll do that working in a team of experienced Software Engineers and Data Scientists building next generation tools and transforming the Fintech industry.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

*
We are building a platform that turns data and information into knowledge and links it to real-world business operations. We do this by creating AI-powered data assets that join up the information flows and physical flows within an organisation to enable trust in data by improving its quality at the source and help businesses find value by using data, information and knowledge to power ML and AI tools that drive real outcomes.

Our first and primary focus is in healthcare operations, where silos in operational information leads to impacts on the ability of clinicians to deliver the most important part of their job: good patient care. These silos reach through a healthcare provider stretching from the point of care out through the healthcare provider’s organisation (a hospital, a clinic, etc.), and into the wider world (community care, supply chains, etc). Our platform will help an organisation to use the data it already has by enhancing at the source to improve trust in the data and link it together using cutting edge techniques of knowledge representation. Our platform uses intelligent software tools and machine learning models to drive value throughout the operational structure, from the point of care out through the provider and into the world, improving patient outcomes, health operations like patient flow, procurement, and more.
The Role
We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our team and contribute to the development of the technology for our platform and to execute on our first client projects leading to our first deployments.

Who we are

At MADE.COM we believe that everyone should have access to great design. So, we’ve taken a unique approach to making and selling furniture - no middlemen, no agents or importers and no high street stores. Instead we work directly with designers and manufacturers so we can offer high-end furniture at attractive prices.

It’s not an easy task – it takes a creative and dedicated team to make it happen where everyone has an important part to play. We combine our individual passions and skills to create innovative work that’s as exciting and unconventional as the business itself. It’s a place where all ideas are listened to, where brainstorming means job titles get left at the door and where a self-starter can really make their mark.

This allows us to eliminate dormant stock and produce big ticket items as close to on-demand as possible, allowing us to make over 1500 new products this year alone. As a company we seek a competitive edge; as technologists and craftsmen we’re no different. We’ve embraced event-driven architectures, DDD, and CQRS in order to achieve our technical goals. We’re trail-blazers in the Python community, and we contribute back by writing and talking about our findings and open-sourcing our tools.

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.
About you:
You are a very experienced and adaptable Data Scientist.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
Our Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHO YOU ARE:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

Data Science at Deliveroo
We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

About Cuvva
A new kind of insurance
We started with a problem: nobody was offering short-term car insurance by the hour.
But we soon realised insurance isn't just lacking. It's completely broken. It's built on layers of middlemen and outdated systems. So Cuvva turned from a simple idea into a full-blown mission: to offer insurance the way it should be.

We think insurance should be fast, flexible and clear.

We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

About the role

In this role, you will be designing and building the algorithmic and machine-learning systems that power Deliveroo. You will be working in a cross-functional team alongside engineers, data scientists specialized in algorithms and inference, and product managers to develop systems that make automated decisions at massive scale. Your team has a high degree of autonomy and works at some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants.

We evaluate the performance of all our decision making machines via robust experimentation, usually through our world class experimentation platform.

We are looking for a senior data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines. These machines may:
Optimise our delivery network by making rider assignment decisions; predicting how long a leg of the delivery journey will take; or mitigating real time delays
Work out how many riders we need in a particular place at a particular time
Optimise consumer and rider fees
Optimise the consumer experience by showing the most relevant restaurants and dishes
Detect fraud and abuse from consumers, riders, and restaurants
Assist restaurants in optimising their presence on Deliveroo, for example by recommending that they improve their menus or photography, or add a popular dish
Create an ML platform to improve our ML and optimisation capabilities
Requirements:
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied.
You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines in industry.
Significant experience with end to end productionisation of these models
Ability to take a fuzzy business objective and turn it into a problem that can be solved via machine learning and optimisation, in particular experience in selecting business-appropriate objective functions
Great communication skills - in person, in writing, in code; to technical and non-technical audiences
Experience creating new decision making machines from scratch, and designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Experience mentoring junior colleagues
A pragmatic, flexible approach, where you most care about achieving impact
Data Science at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.",,Internet,"London, England",Senior Data Scientist - Algorithms,3.5,Unknown / Non-Applicable,Information Technology,1001 to 5000 Employees,Company - Private,2013

Data Science at Deliveroo
At Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.
Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.
Further, we have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.
About the Role

We currently cover twelve markets across Europe, the Middle East and APAC.

We are looking for a data scientist from an algorithms background, to build intelligent decision making machines, primarily to work with the Global Workforce Management & Planning team to help develop and implement resource planning methodologies in order to drive efficiencies and bring a consistency of approach to all markets. You will have a high degree of autonomy and work on some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of riders, consumers, and restaurants relating to customer contacts.
You are someone who knows the fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research and knows when they should be applied. You are a keen problem solver, able to think deeply about a business problem and devise a well-thought-out and pragmatic algorithmic solution. And you get satisfaction from working with non-technical stakeholders and seeing your algorithms shipped and driving measurable impact to the business.
Requirements:
Ability to produce accurate workload forecasts accounting for trends and seasonality in contact rates and order volumes
Ability to produce simulations and what-if scenarios to assist with business cases and provide headcount and cost projections to support managerial decision making
Strong foundation in fundamentals of machine learning and/or operations research
Significant experience building intelligent decision making machines from scratch in industry, designing and building MVPs that quickly get results
Proficient in exploratory data analysis, model/algorithm selection, model pipeline development
Ability to see the bigger picture and understand how your insights are aligned with the direction the business is heading in. You should also be proactive in gathering input from relevant stakeholders to enhance the accuracy and relevance of analysis you produce
Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment with changing requirements
Experience creating strong relationships with customer care operations and support teams and finance managers
Communication skills that clearly present ideas, theories, and technical information to operations and managerial staff

It's a bonus if you have:
Experience using a Workforce Management system in an administrative role within a customer care environment
Experience deploying models to production and experiment monitoring
Experience mentoring junior colleagues

Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist - Reinforcement Learning based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Data Scientist – Causality Expert based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

Data Science at Deliveroo

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors.

Our data scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

We do this by maintaining the rules that make up the WAF (based on wirefilter) and proactively looking for the next vulnerabilities across levels 3-7 of the OSI Model. We can do this by using our massive amounts of data, and work in tandem with vendors to add WAF-based protections before vulnerabilities are disclosed. We accomplish these goals by building the next generation of tools to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities. In response our tooling enables us to iterate quickly on rules, as well as deploying with confidence to our millions of customers. We are a polyglot team that utilizes Rust, Go, and Python to build our services and tools.

DueDil provides real-time insights on every company, helping financial services providers to give small businesses the products they need to thrive.

Reliance on manual checks makes it harder for SMEs to open an account, take out a loan or get insurance cover. It also makes it harder for the companies providing those products to carry out ongoing Know Your Business checks.

DueDil's KYB for Life platform transforms how providers work with SMEs. We analyse billions of data points on millions of companies to provide unique insights via our API.

In the last three years, DueDil has grown rapidly in the UK and Ireland and we're now expanding into mainland Europe. We have over 400 clients across the Financial Services, Insurance and Fintech sectors, including Santander, Tide and Metro Bank.

Our Values

We're driven by three core values, the characteristics that define the members of our team are grit, authenticity, and team spirit. These values factor into the way we hire, promote, and reward every member of our team.

You can read more about our values and how they impact our culture day to day here: https://www.duedil.com/about-duedil/who-we-are

The Role

Critical to achieving DueDil's vision is our ability to combine multiple disparate data sources from different providers into a unified view of companies and the people who run them. This requires us to develop web crawlers, automated matching algorithms, machine learning models and complex ETL processes to tie all these components together.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you'll help enhance and expand our data processing and distributed systems toolsets to support our international expansion effort, while maintaining quality and reliability of our existing data products and services. This will mean dealing with challenges such as order of magnitude increase in data volumes, assessing quality of data from multiple suppliers and building pipelines and services using modern cloud tools to match and extract valuable insight from these datasets. We value DevOps culture so you will take full ownership of your solutions from prototyping all the way to production, and you'll do that working in a team of experienced Software Engineers and Data Scientists building next generation tools and transforming the Fintech industry.

We are looking for

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We are committed to addressing the diversity problem in the tech industry, and that starts with making sure we have a team where everyone feels at home and can contribute as a peer.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

The world is changing around us - the actual physical world is becoming increasingly bound up with the digital, as we learn to model reality; as objects become part of the Internet of Things; as vehicles and infrastructure become autonomous; and as cities and their buildings become 'smart'. Here at WSP we’ve built a successful business by applying our intelligence to the built and natural environments for over a hundred years, earning the hard-won trust of thousands of clients. Now those clients are trusting us to enable them to take advantage of the amazing potential of new digital technologies in order to improve the (real, everyday) lives of millions of (real, everyday) people. This has meant the rapid and ongoing growth of our 'Smart Consulting' division.

We aim to make travel easier and more accessible, encouraging people to make more environmentally sustainable travel choices. We’re hugely proud to be the world’s leading independent rail and coach travel platform and rank among the highest-rated travel and ticketing apps globally. Today, we offer our customers travel to thousands of destinations in and across 45 countries in Europe and beyond. That’s more than £3.7 billion in ticket sales annually, and over 96 million visits to our apps and websites each month. In another major milestone, last summer Trainline listed on the London Stock Exchange and is now part of the FTSE 250.
Our culture is central to our success. We’re driven to sustain our phenomenal growth from recent years, and this means we’re always working closely and collaboratively to turn our ideas into reality. It’s this sense of pace, innovating and improving pretty much everything we do, that makes Trainline so exciting and unique - we truly believe our work has a genuine impact and will change travel for the better.

To support our ambitious commercial goals, we’re expanding our world-class Product division to drive the next stage of our development. In this newly created role, you’ll be working in a hybrid channel and mission org alongside Product Owners, User Researchers, Data Scientists and Engineers to help us revolutionise the travel experience and develop a market leading product and features. The goals are ambitious and the mandate is clear – to make travel more personal.
As a Senior Product Designer, you will champion the need to deeply understand customer needs and craft beautiful, easy to use solutions to meet them. With a strong understanding of interaction design and a love for how visual design complements that, you will own the design experience through the full product process. You’ll be in your element throwing ideas in to help us discover the next big thing, undertaking detailed UX iterations based on customer testing, or designing jaw-dropping visual interactions.
Constant innovation is part of the team’s DNA – it’s all about building new ‘best in class’ features to give users a unique or personalised experience. You may have seen our new SplitSave feature launched earlier this year that finds smart combinations of multiple train tickets to ‘split’ customers’ journeys, giving huge savings without disrupting their travel plans. Similarly, this was the birth place of Crowd Alerts, an app extension we built following the Covid-19 pandemic that uses crowd sourcing data to provide travellers with real-time information about the train they’re on to ensure optimum social distancing when travelling. Here, we pushed from ideation to release within a week…and that’s where you come in.
You’ll join a team of enthusiastic designers looking after the responsive web with a focus on innovating all areas of the product, from inspiration to checkout, ensuring we keep pushing the boundaries of what great looks like when it comes to the travel experience. With a focus on delivering personalised innovation to multiple customer segments, as well as international markets, there’s a lot of room to spread your creative wings and take real ownership of delivering on an idea your passionate about whilst balancing that with an obsession for research, data and metrics.
We work at speed and ship new products every fortnight – key to this is the Google design sprint methodology we employ, and you’ll play an important part in helping drive this momentum. We have a robust and prosperous discovery process and, as such, the role requires leadership of relevant design workshops and rapid iterative ‘discovery’ streams using various prototyping tools and usability tests validating ideas quickly and minimising engineering effort.
This is a truly career defining role for someone passionate about product design looking for an opportunity to disrupt and define a product that will change the way people travel impacting millions of people every day.
Experience
We’re looking for creative big thinkers with small egos who want to build relevant and long-lasting solutions on behalf of millions of customers. As an experienced and passionate design professional, you’ll be a visual and interaction designer in equal parts. In addition, you’ll have experience in running design workshops and bring a user centred design approach to everything you do. You’ll know what ‘great’ looks like and drive towards that relentlessly.
You enjoy complex design challenges, validating ideas with data and customer research, and understand that success is positively impacting customer behaviour, not just about shipping a release. You’ll bring experience designing digital products and systems, not just websites. Additionally, you will be a true self-starter who can deeply collaborate with Engineers and Product Owners. We use Sketch, Zeplin, Framer and Marvel here day-to-day, so a working knowledge of these as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript would be a bonus.

752,Dyad,"About Dyad
*
We are building a platform that turns data and information into knowledge and links it to real-world business operations. We do this by creating AI-powered data assets that join up the information flows and physical flows within an organisation to enable trust in data by improving its quality at the source and help businesses find value by using data, information and knowledge to power ML and AI tools that drive real outcomes.
*
*
Our first and primary focus is in healthcare operations, where silos in operational information leads to impacts on the ability of clinicians to deliver the most important part of their job: good patient care. These silos reach through a healthcare provider stretching from the point of care out through the healthcare provider’s organisation (a hospital, a clinic, etc.), and into the wider world (community care, supply chains, etc). Our platform will help an organisation to use the data it already has by enhancing at the source to improve trust in the data and link it together using cutting edge techniques of knowledge representation. Our platform uses intelligent software tools and machine learning models to drive value throughout the operational structure, from the point of care out through the provider and into the world, improving patient outcomes, health operations like patient flow, procurement, and more.
The Role
We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our team and contribute to the development of the technology for our platform and to execute on our first client projects leading to our first deployments. We are an early stage team, and so this role is perfect for someone with a well-rounded skill set looking to be hands-on with data, modelling, and integration of data science outputs into production software. You will be instrumental in shaping what Dyad’s data science function becomes over time, working with our engineering, knowledge, product and design teams to architect, visualise, model and interpret critical data and ensure that these outputs are integrated into our platform.
This role is great for candidates who wish to advance their career either as a technical specialist or by growing into a leadership role. Remote working is also fully supported for this role.
RequirementsMust have:
PhD in an applied quantitative field (statistics, engineering, mathematics, physics, biology / biostatistics, etc.).
Minimum 2 years experience in a commercial data science role.
Proven experience deploying data science models into a production software environment with a wider team.
Solid understanding of standard NLP models, including recent advances in deep-learning based NLP and transformers; experience with domain-specific models such as BioBERT is a strong plus but not required.
Good software engineering and coding skills in Python and the Python data science ecosystem, including NumPy / Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Space, and deep learning frameworks (TF / PyTorch).
Excellent written and verbal communication skills, and capable of explaining complex concepts to people from a variety of technical backgrounds.
Entrepreneurial drive and the desire to contribute to building an early stage company.
Nice to have:
A solid understanding of graph theory and graph-based data, including graph databases and semantic technologies.
Experience working within teams using modern micro services architectures and CICD / GitOps practices.
Healthcare experience or adjacent (e.g. bioinformatics).
*
*
Examples of things you’d be working on
Developing entity and relationship extraction models and entity linking for unstructured data.
Performing clustering and dimensionality reduction analyses on client data to derive generalisable benchmarking tools.
Developing human-in-the-loop models to scale data annotation.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate.

Senior Data Scientist

Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

838,Cathcart Associates,"Lead Data Scientist required by an early stage, well-funded start-up who are looking to build a first in class solution which will have data science at its heart.
The role:
You will be the only person in the data team right now, with a chance to work closely with the CTO and CEO to build out your own team.
The initial solution has been built and you'll be able to lean on an external consultant initially, so it's not a completely blank canvas, but there is still lots to do.
You'll be working at a small start-up, so you can expect no two days to be the same and you'll get the chance to be involved in pretty much everything from the start.
From a data perspective, they have lots of it, the problem they are solving is novel and the application is pretty obvious, so all in all, a good place to be.
You:
To be successful in the role, you'll have to be confident with working in a small start-up where some days might be a bit mad and you'll roll up the sleeves and get involved in just about everything.
You'll need to be confident in your skills as a Data Scientist, with the ability to talk to non-data people about your work. Communication is key.
From a tech perspective, everything has been written in Python Django and there is a big focus on neural networks and recommender systems within the solution, so experience here would be ideal.
The Company:
Your new company is trying to solve an age old problem, but are coming at it from a slightly different angle, which is not only interesting from a business perspective, but also a data perspective.
They are also able to use this system in numerous different industries, making the potential for diversification very intriguing.
Established by an industry expert and backed by some impressive investors, they have big plans and as machine learning is such a key part to this, this role is critical.
Salary/Package:
The role is with an early stage start-up, so as you might expect, the benefits list isn't huge.
However, they are offering £60-85k salary, depending on experience - they're happy to chat to Senior Data Scientists, Lead Data Scientists, Principal Data Scientists or Heads of if they are keen to still be hands on, hence the range.
On top of this, you'll get generous stock options as a very early employee and flexibility to work from anywhere you want, as long as post-pandemic you are happy to get to their London HQ from time to time.
The interview process is very simple:
Chat to CEO - learn about the business and ask any questions you may have
Chat to their Consultant Data Scientist & CTO on a more technical level
Presentation to CTO, CEO and Consultant on a particular data topic
Hired!
